#  AWS Wavelength Latency Benchmarking

This repository contains code for a simple iOS app that compares the *TCP round-robin* (TCP_RR) results of netperf from two servers. There is also an AWS CloudFormation template that will build suitable servers in an AWS Region and, optionally, an AWS Wavelength Zone.

You can read more about this topic in the blog post *Lower access latency for your apps with AWS Wavelength and our telco partners* on the AWS telco blog page.
